Decision-Tree
=============
A Java program which will be trained by the trainData.txt first. The program then will use the data in testData.txt
to make prediction about the categorization of the document. Finally, the program will output the accuracy of the prediction. 

There are two columns in trainData.txt. The first column represents the document id. The second represents the 
word id. Therefore, a row like "1 12" means "document #1 contains word #12".
